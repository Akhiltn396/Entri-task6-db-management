        <h2>iPhone support to 5G Live in India

          </h2>
      <img src="assets/Screenshot (611).png" alt="">
        <p>Apple has rolled out the latest version of iOS 16 for all iPhone users. The biggest highlight of the iOS 16.2 software update is the 5G connectivity. This update will allow Indian users to access the 5G network on specific iPhone models. Alongside 5G connectivity, the latest iOS update also adds new lock screen widgets, Live Activity, a new app to improve collaboration and more. Let’s check some key features that have arrived with the iOS 16.2 update.</p>

        <p>iPhone users in India can install the new iOS 16.2 update on their devices to start accessing 5G connectivity in areas where it is available. However, it is important to note that Reliance Jio and Airtel are the only telecom providers that have started offering 5G coverage in select cities. So, iPhone users can access the 5G network only from places where the service has already been launched.</p>

        <h2>Why tech insiders are so excited about ChatGPT, a chatbot that answers questions and writes essays</h2>
      <img src="assets/Screenshot (615).png" alt="">
        <p> For his day job, Tobias Zwingmann is the managing partner of RAPYD.AI, a German consulting firm that helps clients make use of artificial intelligence. On the side, Zwingmann teaches online courses on AI.

          Lately, Zwingmann has been generating lecture notes using ChatGPT, a new chatbot that’s quickly become the latest fad in tech. Zwingmann said he recently asked ChatGPT to explain the mechanisms and workings of a machine learning technology known as a DBSCAN, which is short for density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, because he is too “lazy to write it all down.”<br>
          </p>
          <p>
          It is said that the layoffs are a part of "rebalancing" act while "rightsizing certain businesses".
          The report quoted Chuck Robbins, Chairman and CEO of Cisco, who did not divulge into giving direct details related to layoffs but said he would "be reluctant to go into a lot of detail here until we're able to talk to them. I would say that what we're doing is rightsizing certain businesses". "You can just assume that we're going to -- we're not actually -- there's nothing that's a lower priority, but we are rightsizing certain businesses," Robbins further told analysts.

        <h2>Is Web Development a Good Career?</h2>
      <img src="assets/Screenshot (609).png" alt="">
        <p> Mondo’s annual Tech and Digital Marketing Salary guide found “Web Developer” was the most in-demand job title in tech and one of its top-paying jobs. And, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor, the job market for Web Developers is expected to grow 15 percent by 2026.
          </p>
          <p>
            The job outlook for Web Developers as very positive because Web Developers are in high demand across a variety of industries, and a worldwide gap in software and web development skills has most observers forecasting high demand well into the future.
        </p>
        <p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics expects employment of Web Developers to grow eight percent by 2029, much faster than the average for job roles. There is also no sign demand will wane. The expansion of e-commerce — online shopping is now expected to grow faster than the overall retail industry — and an ever-increasing reliance on mobile search will only create further need for talented Web and Software Developers. That means that even if many career changers from other tech disciplines decide they want to become a Web Developer, the job outlook should still remain positive.</p>
